% [Z, Z_TYPES, Z_AGES, Y, Y_TYPES]=simulate_BP(SIM_NUM, T, H, DRAW_S, DRAW_H, DRAW_U, DRAW_Z_0, DRAW_MU, DRAW_IM, APPROX_LIMIT) simulates a
% branching process and returns the number of all particles - Z and the number of particles by type - Z_TYPES.
% Z is a matrix of size NUM_SIM x T/H + 1, containing the simulation paths (the total number of particles for each
% moment of time) in its rows. Z_TYPES is a 3D matrix of size NUM_SIM x N_TYPES x T/H + 1, where N_TYPES is the number
% of types in the branching process. It contains the simulation paths differentiated by types. The sum of all types is
% equal to the total number of particles, stored in Z. Z_AGES contains the simulated age structure of the population 
% by type for every moment of time. It is a 4D matrix of size SIM_NUM x N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1), where N_AGES is the 
% number of discrete ages, used in the simulation. Y is the same size as Z, containing the total progeny of the process (including immigration).
% Y_TYPES is the same size as Z_TYPES, containing the total progeny of the process by types.
% Note: As a 4D matrix, Z_AGES might require a lot of RAM. If the age structure is not requested as an output, then it is
% not stored, to save RAM.
%
% To stop Z_AGES from being calculated as it requires more RAM, add to the arguments: ..., 'GetAgeStructure', false)
% Default value: true.
%
% SIM_NUM is the number of simulations to perform.
%
% T is the horison of the simulation.
%
% H is the time step for continuous-time branching processes.
%
% DRAW_S could be a matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES, representing time-invariant survivability functions for all types of
% particles, where N_AGES is the number of discrete ages in 0:H:<the largest possible age>, and N_TYPES is the number of
% particle types. Or it could be a function that generates the survivability functions for all types of particles on
% every time step. If DRAW_S is a function, then on every call it should generate a random or a constant 3D matrix sized
% N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1), representing the changing survivability function through time.
%
% Note: If DRAW_S is defined as matrix, the environment is time-invariant.
% If it is defined as a function generating the same N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1) matrix, then the environment is varying.
% If it generates different N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1) matrix on every call, then the environment is random.
%
% DRAW_H could be a 2D matrix sized MAX_OFFSPRING x N_TYPES, containing probabilities for 0, 1, ..., MAX_OFFSPRING number
% of children when birth happens, for the different types of particles. It represents the coeficients of the offspring
% generating functions in its columns. If DRAW_H is defined as function, then it should return a 3D matrix sized
% MAX_OFFSPRING x N_TYPES x (T/H+1) on every call. As for DRAW_S, if the matrix is constant, then the environment is
% varying, if it is random, the environment is random.
%
% DRAW_U could be a 2D matrix sized N_TYPES x N_TYPES, containing probabilities for mutations between types. The element
% (i, j) contains the probability for mutation from type j to type i. If DRAW_U is defined as a function, then it should
% return a 3D matrix sized N_TYPES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1) on every call. As for DRAW_S, if the matrix is constant, then the
% environment is varying, if it is random, the environment is random.
%
% DRAW_Z_0 could be a row vector with length N_TYPES, containing the number of initial particles for each type. In that
% case all initial particles are considered to be of age 0 at time 0. Or it could a matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES,
% containing the number of initial particles by age. Or it could be a function that generates a 3D matrix sized
% 1 x N_TYPES x (T/H+1) or N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1), which could be constant or random on every call.
%
% DRAW_MU (Optional) could be a 2D matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES, containing the expected number of births a woman has until age x.
% It could also be defined as a function that returns a matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1), which could be constant
% or random on every call. Use DRAW_MU=[] to model Galton-Watson and Bellman-Harris branching processes, for which
% no point process is defined. Note: choose h and mu such that mu(i,j,t)*h < 1 for all i,j,t!
%
% DRAW_IM (Optional) could be a 2D matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES, containing the number of immigrants on all ages by type.
% It could also be defined as a function that returns a matrix sized N_AGES x N_TYPES x (T/H+1), which could be constant
% or random on every call. When DRAW_IM=[], there is no immigration.
%
% APPROX_LIMIT (Optional, Default=20) determines when the normal approximation of binomial
% distribution is appropriate. When N*p>=approx_limit && N*(1-p)>=approx_limit, the algorithm uses normal approximation.
% This allows handling of large populations without consuming more RAM or CPU time.
% 
% VIRTUES AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE SIMULATION METHOD
%   Theoretical Virtues:
%    - It is one single code that simulates Galton-Watson, Bellman-Harris and General Branching Processes;
%    - It cnsiders multi-type processes with mutations between them;
%    - Mutation probabilities could be constant, varying or random;
%    - It considers constant, varying or random environment;
%    - It considers constant, varying or random immigration;
%    - It considers constant, varying or random initial number of particles on constant, varying or random ages;
%    - It produces not only the total population count, but also the population count by age and type at each moment of 
%       time. 
%    - It could be extended to include controlled branching processes. However, this would most probably require the 
%       code to be customized only for the specific process as the possibilities for such theoretical dependences 
%       between population size, birth, death and migration laws could be quite large;
%   
%   Computational Virtues:
%    - It presents a simple and short code that simulates branching processes;
%    - It is capable of simulating VERY large number of particles (for example: 10^250) in the branching processes, 
%       without requiring a lot of RAM (by using normal approximation of binomial distribution when possible);
%    - The simulation is actually faster for larger populations due to the normal approximation of multinomial 
%       distribution;
%    - It uses all computer cores for faster calculation.
%
%   Restrictions:
%    - Particles cannot die/give birth at the beginning of their life. Probability of that event is considered zero;
%    - Birth and death densities must be smooth functions with exception of finite jump type discontinuities;
%    - The birth, death distributions, mutation probabilities and immigration are independent with each other and with 
%       the branching process itself. So the simulation does not include the class of "controlled branching processes",
%       although it could be extended to suit the specific needs. Depending on the type of controlled process and the 
%       dependence on the age structure at previous times, this task could require a lot of RAM;
%    - It considers only immigration, as emigration is naturally dependent on the population count and age structure 
%       and could be defined in a variety of ways.
%    - Returning the population count by age as an output may require a lot of computer memory (more than a 100 GB RAM
%       in some cases);
